abstract = {The System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire is a broadly used usability measurement tool, which is fast in its application and straight forward in its interpretation. While the original SUS questionnaire was envisioned as a one-dimensional ”quick and dirty” approach to measure usability, research over the past 25 years revealed helpful insights and dimensions to contextualize and compare individual SUS scores on. In this paper, we present an open source web-based analysis toolkit for the SUS questionnaire, which calculates SUS measurements, analyses them based on the insights and contextualization scales suggested by previous work, and provides versatile plotting facilities to create appealing SUS graphs for scientific publications and presentations.},
